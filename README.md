#The Pixel-Net
The PixelNet is a pseudo-centralized p2p botnet written in Python3 that attempts to dynamicize the P2P bootstrapping process by using existing IRC networks to dynmically create a bootstrap channel in said IRC network with a dynamic pattern defined by a pseudo-random seed.

For the imports, and by extension the program, to work, you must use Python 3.9.
