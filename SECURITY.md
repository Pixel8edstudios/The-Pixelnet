# Security Policy

##Supported Versions
Since, for right now, development is moving extremely quickly on this project and right now there is not an actual functional botnet, only the latest version will be supported for security updates.

##What to do if you find a security hole
If you find a security hole in the botnet, start an issue and we'll start work on that security hole, if it is a valid one.
